# FavoriteBusApp

This app has been born from my frustration with the UX of the official tracking website and app of the Cluj-Napoca public transport network. 
At the same time it is also a good opportunity for me to learn and experiment with some stuff like:
- modern .NET features (nullable reference types, global usings etc.)
- .NET Aspire
- React
- Containerization (Docker and Docker Compose)
- Redis Cache
- Github Actions
